// CSES - Apple Division

// There are n apples with known weights. Your task is to divide the apples into two groups so that the difference between the weights of the groups is minimal.
// Input
// The first input line has an integer n: the number of apples.
// The next line has n integers p_1,p_2,\dots,p_n: the weight of each apple.
// Output
// Print one integer: the minimum difference between the weights of the groups.
// Constraints

// 1 \le n \le 20
// 1 \le p_i \le 10^9

// Example
// Input:
// 5
// 3 2 7 4 1

// Output:
// 1

// Explanation: Group 1 has weights 2, 3 and 4 (total weight 9), and group 2 has weights 1 and 7 (total weight 8).
